"A Touchless Turn of Events", The Virtual Mouse Simulator
	by Rohini Banerjee (rohinib)

ABSTRACT: Welcome to "A Touchless Turn of Events"! As the user, you will enter a world where a mouse is no longer needed to control the screen. Instead, you will be able to calibrate your own hand detection program that allows you to control a "mouse" with your own fingers. First, test out your own virtual mouse. Next, participate in a fun maze for points. Finally, draw your own creations with the virtual drawing tablet. At any point in the simulation, click the learning icon to engage with an interactive tutorial that will teach you the steps of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm implemented by the hand detection program.

HOW TO RUN: In your directory of choice, please first download the "TP3" directory. Then open the "Project Codebase" directory. This directory contains all the images/pictures needed to run the program as well as the source code. To run, 1) cd into the TP3 directory "cd TP3", 2) then to the Project Codebase directory "cd Project\ Codebase". 3) Finally, run the following command in your terminal: "python TP3_FINAL.py"

LIBRARIES: All necessary libraries are imported within the code. However, you may need to install the openCV and PIL libraries if necessary. 

SHORTCUTS: Press the arrow icon to skip through the different simulation modes at any point. Press the "ABC" icon to skip to the tutorial aspect at any point. Press 't' at any point to terminate the webcam streaming. Press 'r' during the maze game to reset your position back at the beginning.
